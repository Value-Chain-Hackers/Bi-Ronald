# From Survey to Insight: Automating Resilience Reporting

I'm Christiaan Verhoef, researcher at Windesheim and founder of Value Chain Hackers.  
This project is about more than dashboards — it's about building an end-to-end system that empowers companies and researchers alike to measure, understand, and communicate **supply chain resilience**.

We’re building a pipeline that begins with a simple online **survey**, processes the data into a real-time **dashboard**, and outputs a tailored **report per company** — all using open source tools like Quarto, R, Python, and Supabase.

No more manual copy-pasting, no more unstructured spreadsheets. Just a clean system:  
**Survey in → Clean Data → Live Visuals → Company PDF Out.**

## 💡 Why This Matters

- Many companies want to understand their position in the supply chain — but lack a structured tool to measure it.
- Researchers have the models and expertise, but no scalable, affordable way to deliver tailored results.
- Dashboards often look great — but don’t generate trust if they’re not actionable, consistent, or company-specific.

We're solving this by linking survey tools (like `n8n` or Framaforms) directly to a data pipeline, and then rendering per-company dashboards and PDF reports through Quarto.

This site is the heart of that system.

## 👥 Who This Is For

This project supports:
- **Researchers** looking to automate data intake, analysis, and reporting
- **Consultants & universities** working with multiple stakeholders in sustainability or supply chains
- **SMEs and corporates** participating in the resilience scan who want fast, clear feedback

Our goal is to make it effortless to:
- Fill out a guided questionnaire  
- Get instant insights on a shared dashboard  
- Receive a branded PDF report tailored to your answers  

All fully self-hosted and open source.
