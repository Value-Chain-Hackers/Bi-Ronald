# 📦 Supply Chain Resilience Survey Platform (Open Source, Self-Hosted)

This project deploys a **self-hosted**, open-source platform for:

- ✅ Collecting supply chain resilience survey responses  
- 📄 Automatically generating personalized PDF/HTML reports  
- 📬 Emailing results directly to users  
- 📊 Feeding responses into an admin dashboard  
- 🔮 Future-proofing for AI insights (optional)

> All components are **open-source**, **privacy-first**, and **modular**. Initial deployment runs on an **Oracle Cloud Free VPS** using Docker.
