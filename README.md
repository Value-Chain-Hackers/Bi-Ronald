# Supply Chain Resilience Survey Platform (Integrated with Local AI Stack)

> ‚ÄúWhat if every participant got a personalized report ‚Äî immediately after submitting your survey ‚Äî and you never had to touch a spreadsheet again?‚Äù

---

### What is it?

This is a self-hosted platform that automates the entire research survey process: it collects responses, generates personalized reports, and sends them to participants ‚Äî using only open-source tools, on infrastructure you control.

---

### How does it work?

A participant completes a multi-step survey. Their responses are stored in a secure local database. That data triggers an automated workflow that generates a customized report in PDF or HTML format. The report is then emailed to the participant.

At the same time, the data is saved and ready for structured analysis ‚Äî using dashboards or custom analytics built from your own templates. All services are containerized and run locally: from the survey UI to the report generation, to the delivery process.

---

### Why do I care?

Manual survey reporting is slow. Most cloud tools don‚Äôt meet institutional or ethical standards. And participants rarely receive meaningful feedback.

This system fixes all of that:

- It replaces spreadsheets and templates with a reproducible pipeline.
- It respects data sovereignty, working entirely within your infrastructure.
- It gives participants immediate, personalized feedback.
- It adapts to any research topic ‚Äî from sustainability to compliance to behavioral studies.

It‚Äôs efficient, auditable, and reusable ‚Äî whether for a single study or a recurring academic program.

---

### What‚Äôs the catch?

You‚Äôll need to deploy it yourself. That means using Docker, configuring open-source tools, and maintaining a small server or VM.

But once it‚Äôs live, it runs on its own ‚Äî no SaaS, no exports, no recurring costs.




This system collects supply chain survey data, generates reports, and delivers them via email ‚Äî fully self-hosted using components from the [local-ai-packaged](https://github.com/coleam00/local-ai-packaged) stack.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools Used (All from Local AI Packaged)

| Component            | Tool                  |
|----------------------|-----------------------|
| Survey Frontend      | SurveyJS (static HTML)|
| Workflow Engine      | n8n                   |
| Database             | Supabase (PostgreSQL) |
| Report Generator     | Python or Shell (inside n8n) |
| Email Delivery       | n8n SMTP node         |
| LLM Option (future)  | Ollama                |
| Vector DB (optional) | Qdrant                |
| Dashboard (optional) | Add Metabase manually |
| HTTPS + Routing      | Caddy                 |

## üß≠ Setup Steps

1. **Provision the stack**  
   Clone and run the `start_services.py` from `local-ai-packaged`.

2. **Configure DNS via Cloudflare**  
   Point subdomains (`n8n.yourdomain.com`, etc.) to your cloud instance.

3. **Host the survey**  
   Serve the static SurveyJS wizard with Caddy or GitHub Pages.

4. **Build your workflow in n8n**  
   - HTTP Webhook receives survey data  
   - Store data in Supabase  
   - Trigger script to generate report (HTML or PDF)  
   - Send via SMTP  

5. **Optional: Add Metabase dashboard**  
   Deploy Metabase in `docker-compose.override.yml` and connect to Supabase.

6. **Optional: Enable AI Enhancements**  
   - Use Ollama to summarize answers  
   - Use Qdrant for semantic search or question answering  
   - Use Flowise to build local agents  

---

## üßæ Minimum Workflow (n8n)

1. `HTTP Webhook` ‚Üí Receives JSON from survey form  
2. `Postgres Insert` ‚Üí Saves data to Supabase  
3. `Execute Command` ‚Üí Runs local script to generate report  
4. `Email` ‚Üí Sends report as attachment

---

## üîí Security Notes

- No user auth is enabled in first version  
- No external services are used (fully local)  
- All services are containerized via Docker  
- TLS is managed via Caddy using Let‚Äôs Encrypt

## üì¶ Folder Structure Suggestion

```
/survey/               # Static SurveyJS files
/workflows/            # Exported n8n workflows
/reports/              # Output PDFs/HTML reports
/scripts/              # Report generation scripts
.env                   # Environment configuration
README.md              # This file
```

---

## üì¨ Next Steps

- [ ] Host SurveyJS form via Caddy
- [ ] Build and test n8n workflow
- [ ] Store form results in Supabase
- [ ] Generate and send reports
- [ ] Optionally connect Metabase or AI extensions
